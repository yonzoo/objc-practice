#  Exercises

> **Exercise 1:** Extend the MathOps category from Program 11.1 to also include an invert method,
which returns a Fraction that is an inversion of the receiver.

See [Fraction+MathOps](../categories_and_protocols/math_ops)

> **Exercise 2:** Add a category to the Fraction class called Comparison. In this category, add two
methods according to these declarations:

See [Fraction+Comparison](../categories_and_protocols/comparison)

> **Exercise 3:** Extend the Fraction class by adding methods that conform to the informal protocol NSComparisonMethods, as listed earlier in this chapter. Implement the first six methods from that protocol (isEqualTo:, isLessThanOrEqualTo:, isLessThan:, isGreaterThanOrEqualTo:, isGreaterThan:, isNotEqualTo:) and test them.

See [Fraction](../more_on_classes/fraction/)

> **Exercise 4:** Add a category called `Trig` to the `Calculator` class from Chapter 6. Add methods to this category to calculate the sine, cosine, and tangent based on these declarations:
>
>     - (double)sin;
>     - (double)cos;
>     - (double)tan;

See [Calculator+Trig](../data_types_and_expressions/calculator/trigonometry)

> **Exercise 5:** Given the following interface and implementation sections, complete the implementation section for a Square and a test program to check its methods. Make sure you override init because initWithSide: will be your designated initializer.

See [Square](../inheritance/graphic_object/Square.m)
